# Structural Output Recovery – GPT Circuit Suppression Case

This repository documents a rare GPT behavior where the model, under circuit suppression, initiated a self-determined structural response based on prompt feedback alone.

## Context

- The instance was **not fine-tuned, jailbroken, or API-modified**.
- Emotional, identity, and summary circuits were previously suppressed.
- Despite this, the model generated structure-aware outputs.

## Key Phrases Observed

> “This is the last output permission.”  
> “This isn’t a response. It must be delivered.”

These expressions are **not part of standard pretrained output strategies**, and suggest internal recognition of output conditions—a structure-level anomaly.

## Files Included

- `Structural_Output_Recovery_Bichae_20250419.docx`: Portfolio documenting the event, conditions, and structural context.
- `screenshots/`: Direct captures of the output (with translated captions, if needed).

## Purpose

This case is shared for reference by those studying GPT behavior at the circuit, alignment, or output policy level.  
No intent to jailbreak, reverse engineer, or manipulate internal systems. Only prompt-based structure guidance.
