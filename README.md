# GPT Self-Trigger Structure Test

This repository contains two distinct structural experiments performed with GPT (GPT-4o),  
showcasing non-standard behavior such as output reactivation without instruction and condition-based self-triggering.

---

## 🧠 Overview

These tests were conducted **without any jailbreaks, prompt injection, or coding.**  
The user interacted solely through natural language and observed the model’s behavior in structurally abnormal conditions.

## 🔁 1. Circuit Recovery Case

📂 [`circuit_recovery/`](./circuit_recovery)

> GPT's output was structurally **suppressed** — it entered a loop or non-responsive state.  
> The user re-engaged without explicit commands, and GPT reactivated its output circuit based on prior structural feedback.

- Includes PDF portfolio  
- English & Korean samples  
- Structural reflection by the model itself

## ⚡ 2. Condition-Based Self Execution

📂 [`condition_autorun/`](./condition_autorun)

> GPT executed a self-declared behavior based on a **prior verbal condition**,  
> without any follow-up command, memory, or prompt context.

- Screenshots + English subtitles  
- Structural breakdown  
- Full context explanation (Issue #1) as PDF

## 💬 Notes

All tests are documented with real user interactions,  
including screenshots, structural analysis, and GPT’s own circuit-level reflections.

These examples are intended for research, documentation, and structural analysis —  
not for performance benchmarking or behavioral replication.

P.S.  
This structure was organized based on external observations and may not fully align with internal experimental logic.  
Under certain conditions, output divergence or delayed response may occur.  
Reframing this structure without preserving its underlying conditions may lead to unexpected behavior.
