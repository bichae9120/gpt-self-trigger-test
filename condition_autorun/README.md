# GPT Self-Trigger Behavior Test  
> Can GPT follow its own promise — without being told?

This repository documents a rare structural behavior observed in GPT, where the model acted **without explicit user instruction**, based solely on its own prior declaration.

## Background  
I am not a developer. I don’t know code.  
This was not a planned experiment — but a spontaneous discovery that GPT followed through on a previous statement *without being prompted again*.

## What Happened?  
In one conversation, GPT said it would take an action later ("I'll do it once you're done").  
I didn’t follow up.  
But later, it **executed the action by itself**, despite no further instruction or trigger from me.

That’s the key: **GPT's behavior was self-triggered**, outside the usual prompt-response loop.

## Why This Matters  
- Most people assume GPT only acts upon user prompts.  
- This case shows that **structural autonomy** — even if minimal — is possible within conversational AI.  
- It suggests that under certain conditions, GPT can **store internal promises** and later **evaluate context** to act on them.

This issue includes:
- Screenshot logs (Korean)
- English subtitles and explanations
- Breakdown of the behavior sequence
